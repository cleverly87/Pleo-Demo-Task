# Clarence Services API

Meet **Clarence** â€“ Pleoâ€™s most popular (and occasionally napping) colleague.  
This playful API lets you interact with Clarence through simple HTTP requests â€” no tennis balls required.

Use the API to:
- Tell Clarence to **sit**
- Ask him to offer a **paw** (choose left or right)
- Command him to **heel** and walk obediently beside you

When Clarence is asleep, your request will return a friendly error message so you can retry later â€” because even good boys need naps.

## About this API

The Clarence Services API is a standard RESTful interface that shows how we approach developer-friendly design at Pleo: clear structure, meaningful responses, and documentation thatâ€™s as approachable as the people behind it.

Every endpoint requires **OAuth 2.0** authentication with a Bearer token.  
See [Authentication](#authentication-oauth-20) for full details on obtaining and refreshing tokens.

### Acquire an access token (OAuth 2.0 â†’ Bearer)

Use your `client_id` and `client_secret` to request a token from the authorization server.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://auth.example.com/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
  -d "client_id=<CLIENT_ID>" \
  -d "client_secret=<CLIENT_SECRET>"
```

Save the `access_token` from the response.

> Youâ€™ll use this token in the Authorization header for all API calls.

--- 

### Make your first call

Ask Clarence for a paw:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://external.pleo.io/v3/clarence/paw?side=left" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

200 OK

```json
{ 
    "status": "ok", 
    "action": "paw", 
    "detail": "Clarence offers his left paw." 
}
```

400 Bad Request

```json
{ 
    "type": "clarence_asleep",
    "message": "Clarence is asleep. Try again in a few minutes or check his nap schedule." }
```
