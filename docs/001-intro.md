### Acquire an access token (OAuth 2.0 â†’ Bearer)

Use your `client_id` and `client_secret` to request a token from the authorization server.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://auth.example.com/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
  -d "client_id=<CLIENT_ID>" \
  -d "client_secret=<CLIENT_SECRET>"
```

Save the `access_token` from the response.

> Youâ€™ll use this token in the Authorization header for all API calls.

```
